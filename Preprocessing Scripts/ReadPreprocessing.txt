subject to change into greater detailed instruction

for now,

place your dataset into the preprocessing folder and set the name to 'dataset'
run the two scripts:
  resize.py "python -m resize.py"
  deletebw.py "python -m deletebw.py"

you can change the program to change the path and use any folder you want
